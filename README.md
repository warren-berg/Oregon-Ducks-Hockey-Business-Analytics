# Oregon-Ducks-Hockey-Business-Analytics
As President of the UO Ducks Hockey Team, I was curious to determine my performance as President compared that of past coordinators. I scraped data from past financial ledgers and performed data analysis to measure business performance of the Club from 2004-2020.

The data for this project was stored in Excel, so for ease of use, I conducted the Analysis in Excel.
